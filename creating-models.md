So in Phoenix we create a user model in the models directory, conventionally named singular-named-model.ex. We create the model using the `Schema` macro with a name for the schema. inside that we define fields with their names as atoms followed by the field type. Perhaps timestamps macro to boot for the inserted_at and updated_at fields. then we pop over to iex and create a migration with mix ecto.gen.migration migration_name. Then we go into the migration file and make the migration match our user model. Then we run mix ecto.migration to run the migration and create the appropiate tables in our DB.
